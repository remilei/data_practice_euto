## README

This repo conatins all code and results for the document about data and coding practices.

The HTML document is generated using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) format that include both coding and Mardown. The source file is the `data_practices_eu_tax.qmd`. We use the [Lumo template](https://github.com/holtzy/lumo) that we adapt with the design of the EU Tax.

To generate the document, Quarto must be installed. The generic command is `quarto render data_practices_eu_tax.qmd` in the console.
