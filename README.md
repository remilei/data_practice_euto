## README

This repo contains all code and results for the document about data and coding practices.

The HTML document is generated using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) format that include both coding and Markdown. The source file is the `index.qmd`. We use the [Lumo template](https://github.com/holtzy/lumo) that we adapt with the design of the EU Tax.

To generate the document, Quarto must be installed. The generic command is `quarto render index.qmd` in the console. Otherwise, you can use other software such as VS Code or RStudio.
